This is a custom repo for workflow tools associated with a custom project to tag in and out timestamps of words in TV programs recorded with the HDHomeRun Digital TV tuner.

Perhaps in the future these tools can be standardized and documented, but for now I would imagine that they are fairly cryptic and unhelpful for other users.
